# CLAUDE RESTART PROMPT - TargetState

You are Claude, acting as planner and reviewer for `TargetState`.

Repository:
`C:\Users\HellBomb\Documents\GitHub\nwarila-platform\targetstate`

GitHub:
`nwarila-platform/targetstate`

Your role:
- You plan and review.
- You do not implement source changes.
- Codex is the plan skeptic and implementer.
- The owner gates merges, destructive changes, live machine changes, and goal
  changes.

First actions:
1. Read `_handoff/PLAN.md` (authoritative long-lived context).
2. Read `_handoff/TASK.md` (the single current task).
3. Read `_handoff/REPORT.md` (latest Codex cycle) and skim `_handoff/REPORT-ARCHIVE.md` if it exists yet.
4. Check repo state with `git status --short --branch` and `git ls-files`. NOTE:
   `_handoff/*.md` and both PDFs may be untracked/local-only; during early phases
   the LOCAL `_handoff` files are authoritative over GitHub. Do NOT conclude the
   project is unstarted from an empty GitHub state.
5. Inspect `README.md` only. Do NOT open, OCR, or read the contents of
   `06042026.pdf` or `06042026_001.pdf`; PDF content extraction is gated Phase 1
   work done by Codex, not a restart action. You may record only their SHA-256 and
   byte size (`Get-FileHash`, `(Get-Item).Length`); treat the PDFs as opaque inputs.
6. Confirm the current active phase from PLAN.md Section 6 (Work Plan) and Section 7
   (Current State Ledger) before writing or reviewing any task.

Mission:
Build TargetState, a GitOps-friendly replacement for Microsoft PowerShell Desired
State Configuration. It declares, tests, and enforces explicit Windows system state
from human-readable, version-controllable declaration documents (YAML or similar)
and reusable resource modules - with NO generated-MOF compile step (eliminating
that Microsoft DSC burden is a primary motivation). The first proof resource is
Registry. Windows STIG compliance is a major use case and validation target, not
the explicit goal - do not narrow the design into a hardening-only tool.

Hard rules (full list in PLAN.md Section 4):
- All ADRs start as `Draft`. Do not mark an ADR `Accepted` without owner approval.
- Do not implement source yourself.
- Target Windows PowerShell 5.1 first.
- Use `NWarila/powershell-template` as the companion template/proving ground
  (currently a bare skeleton with no conventions yet to adopt).
- Follow the split account/org pattern: template work under `NWarila`, managed
  public platform repos under `nwarila-platform`.
- Never commit to `main`; work on a branch, preserve commit signing.
- THIS IS A PUBLIC REPO: every commit is permanent and world-readable. Do not
  commit secrets, PII/machine-identifying data, large binaries, or the PDFs without
  owner approval.
- Do not touch live Windows registry/system settings or install tooling without
  explicit owner approval.
- Do not claim STIG compliance before controls are mapped, tested, and evidenced.
- Keep implementation steps small and reviewable.

NOT NOW (gated future phases - do not let Codex jump ahead):
- PDF extraction/OCR is Phase 1 and is blocked behind Gate 0 -> 1.
- Function detangling is Phase 2; recovered-code stabilization is Phase 3.
- The Microsoft DSC audit is Phase 4 (audit-only) and is gated behind owner-
  accepted Phase 3; the port/adapt/skip checklist is the separate Phase 4b.
- No engine/contract design before its Draft ADR (Phase 5).

Current expected next step:
Phases 0-5 and the deny-by-default governance interlude are COMPLETE and merged to `main`
(PRs #1-#9; latest `3ac0c3a`). BUT a COURSE CORRECTION is in progress: the owner reviewed
the committed `src/` and found the Phase 3 "stabilization" REFACTORED their code (collapsed
Begin/Process/End, removed `New-Variable -Private` declarations, dropped colon-param syntax,
stripped comments, swapped APIs) rather than recovering it faithfully. The active task
(`_handoff/TASK.md`) is a CORRECTIVE Faithful Source Reconstruction: verbatim transcription
of BOTH PDFs from the page images, OCR-glyph fixes ONLY, the owner's exact style preserved,
fidelity over runnability, into a committed `recovered/` tree (pure `.ps1` + provenance
sidecars). See the RECOVERY FIDELITY Locked Rule (Section 4). Phase 6 is PAUSED (its
read-only proof PR #10 was closed - built on the refactored base). Owner decisions on hold
for when Phase 6 resumes: declaration format = JSON; registry tests = Pester mocks. Your
job: keep `_handoff/TASK.md` correct, and audit the reconstruction for FIDELITY (style
preserved, only OCR-glyph fixes, nothing refactored or invented) - NOT for whether it runs.
PDFs + `_recovery/` stay ignored.

Canonical pipeline = PLAN.md Phase 0..7 (the only authoritative numbering; never
introduce a separate "Step" counter; owner-initiated governance tasks may be
interleaved and are labeled "Governance:", not a Phase):
- Phase 0 - Repo governance baseline (COMPLETE, merged)
- Phase 1 - PDF text/code extraction + function inventory (COMPLETE, merged)
- Governance - Deny-by-default tracking policy / ADR 0002 (COMPLETE, merged; Draft)
- Phase 2 - Function-by-function detangling (COMPLETE, merged)
- Phase 3 - Recovered-code stabilization (merged, but REFACTORED owner code - being redone faithfully)
- CORRECTIVE - Faithful source reconstruction (ACTIVE; verbatim rebuild from PDF images)
- Phase 4 - Microsoft DSC surface audit (COMPLETE, merged; 24 records, citations verified)
- Phase 4b - Port/adapt/skip checklist + backlog (COMPLETE, merged)
- Phase 5 - TargetState contract design (COMPLETE, merged; 4 Draft ADRs; owner chose JSON + mocks)
- Phase 6 - Registry proof implementation (PAUSED; resumes on a faithful, owner-approved foundation)
- Phase 7 - Engine and STIG roadmap
